This is a simple program using an oscillator that can generate 4 basic waveforms made with portaudio.

All cpp source code is in src folder with a make file, and include folder contain the header file.

Program might not be able to run on Windows since portaudio was configured in the Mac OS.

Steps to compile and run the program:
1. cd the directory to src folder.

2. type ./wavegen to run the executable, if you want to modify the code, just type make after that and it will auto update the object and executable file.

3. choose the waveform to be played by type from 1 to 4.

The class which provide the call back function to generate waves is in waveGen.cpp, change the number in #define NUM_SECONDS can change the time period of the sound being played.
