This homework uses C++14 gcc complier, so if it’s no installed in you computer it might not be able to be compiled.

Operating system must be Unix or Linux in order to run this program.

step1:
use cd command change to this folder as its current directory.

step2:
type make will compile it to an executable and two object files.

step3:
type./writecsd will run the executable.

step4:
to clean the object files, executable and .csd file, type make clean after quit the program.

In this example, it’ll generate a .csd file that will play either a C major chord or G dominant chord, type the amplitude and choose a chord between this two. note that it won’t work if you forget to add '_' in the middle (C_major).
